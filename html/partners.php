			Ballot Path would not be possible without our many partnerships. The website has been constructed by computer science students from Portland State University working on their senior year capstone project. We would also like to acknowledge the significant help given by Phil Keisling, especially in beginning formative stages of the project.<br><br>

			To collect and manage the election candidacy information, Ballot Path has depended upon a network of Oregon public University students, who worked independently and remotely to gather the information on Oregon’s roughly 7000 elected officials. Ballot Path’s breakthrough moment occurred when the Sunlight Foundation awarded $10,000 in grant money towards the completion of the project in Oregon. The Sunlight Foundation’s support gave Ballot Path a validation among civic-tech organizations and universities throughout the country.<br><br>

			Ballot Path was significantly helped by other individuals and organizations as well, such as the Technology Association of Oregon, Code for Portland, Hack Oregon, Beau Buck, Joe Marushak, and many others.<br><br>
